### 1. Motivation
This topic was selected to complete the project for a Data Scientist Nanodegree on Udacity. For the purpose of the analysis, I selected the Seattle AirBnB publicly available data that shows the listings for 2016. I narrowed down the analoysis objective to find out what are the factors that contribute to how much the property is booked throughout the year. In the course of my analysis, I will try to answer the following questions:

1. What is the main factor impacting property occupancy rate?
2. How do price and property rating imact the property occupancy?
3. What are additional factors that need to be considered to increase property occupancy?

### 2. File Descriptions
There are two files:
- SeattleAirB&B_fin.ipynb - the notebook with the python code 
- SeattleAirVaBBlogPost_fin.docx - the word document with the summary of the analysis as a blog post

### 3. How to Interact with the Project
I suggest to read the blog first to understand the intent and the summary of the analysis. The jupyter notebook has more detailed analysis, code and diagrams. To run the code, you will need to get the data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/

### 4. Licensing and Acknowledgements

Data used for this analysis is sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/ and published under CC0 Public Domain license. I used the seaborn tutorial from https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/seaborn-tutorial-for-beginners for diagrams and also StackOverflow posts referenced in the code.
